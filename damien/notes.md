# Lidar Notes
[or this...](https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads) - I had to log in

I got this error https://community.silabs.com/s/question/0D58Y00008u8b0SSAQ/cp210x-to-vcp-driver-failed-to-build-for-kernel-513-ubuntu-2004?language=en_US


after running make in the driver folder, I ran ```sudo modprobe cp210x``` not sure if it did anything... but didn't fail!!
